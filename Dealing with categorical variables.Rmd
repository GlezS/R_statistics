## Introduction

Categorical variables are commonly included in datasets.  They (usually) consist of a finite sample space of data point values that are either _nominal_ in nature, i.e. characters and strings without a natural order, or _ordinal_ in nature, that is, symbols that can be placed in a natural order.

An example of the former is a binary variable such as _Smoking_ (assuming that there are no _unknown_ cases).  A patient either smokes or does not, so the sample space would have the elemnts _yes_ and _no_.

A survey is a great example of ordinal categorical variables.  Patients might be asked to rate their pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain).  There is a natural order to the elements of the sample space, but no fixed difference between each element.  It is therefor not a numerical variable.

When using strings and characters, R assigns the elements in the sample sapce of a categorical variable a __factor__ type.  The factor type has many benefits, but can also get in the way of your data analysis.  By default, libraries in the _tidyverse_ do not assign this type to character and string elements.  To make use of the benefits of factors, we need to use the _forcats_ library.

## Creating factors

In the code cell below, we create a string vector for a hypothetical project.  One of the statistical variables might capture the type of lung disease that a patient has.  The sample space includes the elements _None_, _COPD_, _Chronic bronchitis_, and _Asthma_.

```{r Lung disease object for 10 patients}
lung_disease <- c("None", "None", "COPD", "None", "Asthma",
                  "Asthma", "Chronic bronchitis", "None", "Asthma", "COPD")
```

One problem with this dataset might become apparent when we want to sort the data point values.

```{r Sorting the lung diseases variable}
sort(lung_disease)
```

By default, sorting will be alphabetical.  This might not be your intention, though.  Turning the _lung\_disease_ object into a factor will help in changing this behavior.  The first step is to create your own order.  This is referred to as creating _levels_ (the elements in the sample space of the variable).

```{r Creatinglung disease levels}
lung_disease_levels <- c("None", "Asthma", "Chronic bronchitis", "COPD")
```

Now we can create a factor object.

```{r Creating a factor type object}
lung_disease_factor <- factor(lung_disease,
                              levels = lung_disease_levels)
```

Sorting will now occur according to the levels.

```{r Sorting according to the levels}
sort(lung_disease_factor)
```

The `sort()` function returns both the sorted data point values and the sorted sample space.

The use of the `factor()` function can aid in detecting misspelled words, i.e. data point values that are not in the sample space for the variable in question.  Below we use the `append()` function to add just such a data point value.

```{r Adding adata pointvalue outside of the sample space}
lung_disease <- append(lung_disease, "CPOD")  # Incorrect spelling
```

Let's create a new factor from using the original levels, this time using the _parse\_factor()_ function from the `readr` library.

```{r Using the readr library}
lung_disease_factor_2 <- parse_factor(lung_disease,
                                      levels = lung_disease_levels)
```

R actually returns a warning!  It tells use that _CPOD_ is not a level (sample space element).

## Importing data files

Let's have a look at the behavior of a `csv` data file import that contains categorical variables.  Below, we create two objects from the data file.  The first uses the `read.csv()` base function.  It creates a `data.frame` object.  The `read_csv()` function from the `readr` library creates a `tibble` object.

```{r Importing as a data.frame}
data_1 <- read.csv("Data_forcats.csv")
```

We can take a quick look at the statistical variables in the data file.

```{r Variables}
names(data_1)
```

The _City_ variable is nominal categorical.  Let's print all the data point values.

```{r Showing all the data point values in the City variable for the data frame}
data_1$City
```

These are clearly strings.  When we use the `typeof()` function, though, we note that the variable has an `integer` data type.

```{r Type of data_1 City variable}
typeof(data_1$City)
```

This is because this variable is seen as a factor.  We can use the `levels()` function as before, to look at the sample space of the variable.

```{r Sample space of the City variable in data_1}
levels(data_1$City)
```

Now, let's use the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` library.  It creates a `tibble` object that does not convert a categorical variable into a factor.

```{r Import using readr, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data_2 <- readr::read_csv("Data_forcats.csv")
```

The actual data point values are still the same.

```{r Showing all the data point values in the City variable for the tibble}
data_2$City
```

They are, though, of a type that we would expect, i.e. the `charater` type.

```{r Type of data_2 City variable}
typeof(data_2$City)
```

Unfortunately, we lose the ability to return the sample space with the `levels()` function, as the variable is no longer a factor.

```{r There are no levels in the tibble as there are no factors}
levels(data_2$City)
```

using the design ethos of the `tidyverse`, we can still get the sample space incorporating the `count()` function.

```{r Sample space by using the count function}
data_2 %>% dplyr::count(City)
```

We can order the counts too with the `sort = TRUE` argument.

```{r Sample space by using the count function (with sorting of size)}
data_2 %>% dplyr::count(City,
                        sort = TRUE)
```

Note that in both cases, the result is a tibble.

## The `forcats` library

To use the advantages of factors in tibbles, we can use the `forcats` library.  It contains many useful functions.  Below we turn the `data_2` tibble object's _City_ variable into a factor using the `as_factor()` function.  This becomes the argument in the `fct_unique()` function so that we can view the sample space of the variable.

```{r Unique elements}
forcats::fct_unique(forcats::as_factor(data_2$City))
```

### Returning the sample space of a variable

The `fct_unique()` function shows the elements of the sample space of the _City_ variable in the order in which they appear and then lists them again as factor levels.

Using the pipe operator, ` %>% `, we can do the same in a `tidyverse` way.

```{r Showing sample space}
data_2$City %>% as_factor() %>% fct_unique()
```

The `fct_count()` function returns a tibble with two columns.  The first is the elements in the sample space and the second is the count of each of the elements in the dataset.

###  Returning a count of the elements of a sample space

```{r Showing sample space and counts}
data_2$City %>% as_factor() %>% fct_count()
```

While we explicitly converted the _City_ variable into a factor, the code chunk below shows that it is not necessary.  Using the `forcats` functions will turn a variable (vector object in this case) into factor.  Below we create the same tibble as before, but this time we sort the order by count.

```{r Showing ordered sample space by counts}
data_2$City %>% fct_count(sort = TRUE)
```

We can also return a simple table using the `table()` base function.

```{r Count with alphabetical element order presented as a table}
data_2$City %>% table()
```

The result is an alphabetical list.  We can use the `fct_inorder()` function to change this to a descending count order.

```{r Count with size order presented as a stable}
data_2$City %>% fct_inorder() %>% table()
```

### Lumping levels together

In this dataset we have a sample space with $10$ elements.  It is not always practical or important to show all of the elements.  We can lump unimportant elements and their count into an _Other_ element using the `fct_lump()` function.  In the code chunk below, we use the argument `n = 3` to return at least three elements.  Ties are included.

```{r Show 3 most common (including ties) and place in size order}
data_2$City %>% fct_lump(n = 3) %>% fct_inorder() %>% table()
```

We note one two-way tie and a three-way tie, so they are all included in the top three.  If there was another tie of say two counts of $55$, they will not be shown, as we are already exceeding three elements, although they will technically be tied for third place.

With negative numbers, we can show only the rarest elements in the sample space.

```{r Show least common 2 (including ties) and place in order}
data_2$City %>% fct_lump(n = -2) %>% fct_inorder() %>% table()
```

Lumping data together really helps with plotting.  Below is a bar chart for `n = 3` elements.

```{r}
barplot(data_2$City %>% fct_lump(n = 3) %>% fct_inorder() %>% table(),
        main = "Frequency of cities",
        col = "orange",
        xlab = "City",
        ylab = "Count",
        las = 1)
```

### Collapsing and renaming levels

Any elements in the sample space of a categorical variable can be lumped together and even renamed.  In the code chunk below, we use the`fct_collapse()` function to collapse the levels into _USA_, _EU_, and _Other_.

```{r Collapsing levels manually}
data_2$City %>% 
  fct_collapse(USA = c("NY", "SF", "LA", "SD"),
                             EU = c("London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Amsterdam"),
                             Other = c("Cape Town", "Sydney")) %>% 
  fct_inorder() %>% 
  fct_count()
```

### Renaming levels

Levels can be renamed manually using the `fct_recode()` function.  Below, we change _Cape Town_ to _CT_

```{r Renaming levels}
data_2$City %>% 
  fct_recode(CT = "Cape Town") %>% 
  fct_inorder() %>% 
  fct_count()
```
