## Introduction

The WorldBank(R) provides open data for hundreds of indicators.  These indicators are available for most contries spanning many years.  You can learn more at https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/ 

The `WDI` library provides easy access to the data.  In this post, I will take a look at the maternal mortality ratio indicator for the United States of America, Brazil, and South Africa.

(The appropriate libraries have been imported.  The `plotly` library will be used for plotting and the `dplyr` library will be used to extract data for plotting.  The `WDI` library uses the World Bank API to send search queries.  A local cache is held for some of the data such as the indicator names.  The `WDIcache()` command can be run to update the cache held for searches.)

## Looking up an indicator

The World Bank data that is availabe through this API provides many variable including _iso2c_ country codes, names of the variables, and many more.  The `WDISearch()` command allows strings to be searched for in these variables.  In the code block below a search for _maternal mortality ratio_ is made in the _name_ variable.

```{r}
WDIsearch(string = "maternal mortality ratio",
          field = "name",
          short = FALSE)
```

Two indicators are returned.  The `short = FALSE` argument allows for the detailed information.

## Searching for the data

In the code block below, the `WDI()` command is used to return a `data.frame` of the three countries listed for the specified indicator, from 2005 to 2015.  The `extra = FALSE` argument returns a shortened set of variables.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
WDI(country = c("US",
                "BR",
                "ZA"),
    indicator = "SH.STA.MMRT",
    start = 2005,
    end = 2015,
    extra = FALSE))
```

The first six rows can be viewed using the `head()` command.

```{r}
head(df)
```

The full list of variables is shown below.

```{r}
names(WDI(country = "US",
          indicator = "SH.STA.MMRT",
          start = 2015,
          end = 2016,
          extra = TRUE))
```


## Filtering the data

In the code block below the `filter()` command is used to create three `data.frame` objects, one for each country.

```{r}
brazil <- df %>% filter(iso2c == "BR")
usa <- df %>% filter(iso2c == "US")
za <- df %>% filter(iso2c == "ZA")
```

## Plotting the data

The code block below creates three traces for a single plot using `plotly`.  

```{r}
trace0 <- brazil$SH.STA.MMRT
trace1 <- usa$SH.STA.MMRT
trace2 <- za$SH.STA.MMRT
dts <- brazil$year

df.plot <- data.frame(dts, trace0, trace1, trace2)

p1 <- plot_ly(df.plot,
              x = ~dts,
              y = ~trace0,
              name = "Brazil",
              type = "scatter",
              mode = "lines+markers") %>% 
  add_trace(y = ~trace1,
            name = "USA",
            type = "scatter",
            mode = "lines+markers") %>% 
  add_trace(y = ~trace2,
            name = "RSA",
            type = "scatter",
            mode = "lines+markers") %>% 
  layout(title = "Maternal mortality per 100,000 births",
         xaxis = list(title = "Year",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(title = "Count",
                      zeroline = FALSE))
p1
```

## Conclusion

The WDI library is extremely easy to use, yet powerful enough to bring a massive open data resource to you desktop.  Learn more about it at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WDI/WDI.pdf
